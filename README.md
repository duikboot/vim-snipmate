============

Snippets for vim using snipmate + pathogen compatible bundle

This are the snippets for the following libraries: 
* chaijs ( http://chaijs.com/ )
* mocha ( http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/ )
* YUI ( http://yuilibrary.com/ )

Simple snippet loader is included in here in order to make snippets pathogen compatible,
which means you can install them as any pathogen bundle.

All snippets begin with a prefix of the library in order to keep them separate
from each other, e.g., `expect(false).to.be.ok;` is `chai.ok`
